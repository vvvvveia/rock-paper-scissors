# Rock, Paper, Scissors

A simple game of rock, paper, scissors for The Odin Project assignment [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

This initial versoin of it will be just devtools console-based, but I am planning to come back and eventually add a GUI with buttons and text.
